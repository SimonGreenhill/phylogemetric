# Summary

Phylogemetric is a Python library for calculating the áºŸ-score [@Holland2002] and Q-Residual [@Gray2010] for phylogenetic data. These
methods are used in studies of linguistic and cultural evolution to quantify reticulation in data. 

This Python library provides a command-line script interface for use on Nexus-formatted data [@Nexus], and an importable Python
library for use on any binary matrix.
